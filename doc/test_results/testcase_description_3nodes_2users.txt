This run tested the case where there were 3 nodes running and 2 users. Each user
submitted a set of jobs with 3 tasks. Thus, this run tests the case in which
there are insufficient nodes for the available tasks, and the head must a set
of jobs waiting for available resources.

console_output_3nodes_2users.txt contains the console output of the head node
from the test run.

beryllium.tar.gz and sodium.tar.gz contain the results of the jobs submitted
by those respective nodes.

The head node reported successful completion, and the contents of the result
tarballs is as expected, thus the test passed.
