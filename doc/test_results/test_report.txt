beryllium.tar.gz: Result received by the user Beryllium during the 3 nodes and
	2 users test case. 
Note that this is the same result which the user Beryllium received during the 3
	nodes and 1 user test case.  (we used the same job request for each test
	case)

Test Report
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A set of tests intended to maximize code coverage was constructed.

1. Tested the cluster using 1 user submitting 3 tasks to a cluster of 3 nodes.
	This tests the case where there are sufficient nodes for the pending
	tasks. This test also included the joining, departure, and rejoining of
	nodes from the cluster (See console output for details, look before the
	job connection is made).
2. Tested the cluster using 2 users submitting 3 tasks (6 total) to a cluster of
	3 nodes. This tests the case where there are insufficient nodes for the
	pending tasks.

The cluster passed both tests. We deem that the cluster conforms to the RFC.
