This run tested the case where there were 3 nodes running and 1 user. The 1 user
submitted a set of jobs with 3 tasks. Thus, this run tests the case in which
there are sufficient nodes for the available tasks.

console_output_3nodes_1users.txt contains the console output of the head node
from the test run.

beryllium.tar.gz contains the results of the jobs submitted by that node.

The head node reported successful completion, and the contents of the result
tarball is as expected, thus the test passed.
